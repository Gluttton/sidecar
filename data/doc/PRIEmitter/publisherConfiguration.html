<h1>Publisher Configuration</h1>

<p>
The PRIEmitter application can publish its data on a TCP/IP socket or on a
multicast UDP socket. The former guarantees delivery of all the data, with some
limits on throughput due to increased overhead, while the latter offers
potentially greater throughput at the risk of missing or dropped messages.
