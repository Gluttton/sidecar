<h1>Frequency Control</h1>

<p>
The PRIEmitter application attempts to determine the overall frequency of the
messages in the data file, and reports the calculated value in
the <b>Frequency</b> data entry field. If desired, you may change this value to
affect how often the application emits the the recorded messages.
</p>

<blockquote>
<b>NOTE:</b> the timing mechanism used to control message emission is not very
exact, and it may not be able to support high frequency rates. The Playback
application does not have these limitations.
</blockquote>

<p>
Instead of adjusting the frequency value, you may instead skip over one or more
messages by changing the <b>Step</b> value. The default value of one, emits
every message in the loaded file. A value of 2 emits every other message. For
values greater than 1, the application will adjust the azimuth fields of the
message header to account for the missing messages. This may result in visual
anomalies in some of the SideCar display applications, notably PPIDisplay.
