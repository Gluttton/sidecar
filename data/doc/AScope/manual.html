<h1>AScope Application</h1>

<p>The Playback application attempts to emit data recorded by the SideCar
system. The application uses the timestamps recorded in the data files to
replicate the original arrival rates seen by the SideCar recorder.</p>

<h2>Loading Recording Files</h2>

<p>You may select a directory containing recorded data in one of two ways:
clicking on the <b>Load</b> button and navigating into the directory to load,
or typing in the location by hand in the text field to the right of
the <b>Load</b> button. The text field also contains a collection of
previously-visited directory locations. Simply click on the triangle at the
right of the text field to view previous load locations. Selecting one of the
shown entries will load the indicated directory.</p>

<h2>Channel Activation</h2>

<p>Specific data channels may be enabled or disabled by simply clicking on the
checkbox to the left of the channel name. Channels without a check mark next to
their name will not emit any data when playback is active.</p>

<h2>Playback Control</h2>

<p>To begin emitting recorded data, simply press the <b>Start</b> button.
Likewise to stop, press the button again. The button's label will change
depending on whether or not playback is active.</p>

<p>To jump to the beginning of the recorded data, press the <b>Rewind</b>
button. You may press this button at any time, even while a playback is active.
To jump elsewhere in time, enter a time value in the <b>Jump To</b> field. You
can enter relative or absolute time values, like so:</p>

<ul>
<li>+53s &mdash; jump 50 seconds ahead</li>
<li>-3m &mdash; jump 3 minutes back</li>
<li>15.03.23 or 15:03:23 &mdash jump to an absolute time of 15:03:23</li>
</ul>

<p>Relative times may contain a suffix that describes the time units: <b>h</b>
for hours, <b>m</b> for minutes, and <b>s</b> for seconds. If not given the
units defauls to seconds. Absolute times must always consist of at least 8
characters, with minutes and seconds always having two digits of value and the
hours having two or more.</p>

<p>Both time formats support fractional second values to the right of a decimal
point in the time value. For instance, the time value <b>+0.001</b> will
attempt to jump forward by 1/1000th of a second.</p>

<h2>Rate Control</h2>

<p>To change the rate at which the playback clock runs, click on
the <b>Rate</b> widget. Selecting <b>Normal</b> will cause the playback clock
to run at the same speed as the wall clock. Selecting values greater than one
will cause the playback clock to run faster than real time, while choosing
fractional values less than one will cause it to run slower than real time.</p>

<p>Although the rate setting may be changed at any time, for best playback
fidelity, stop any active playback before changing the playback rate.</p>

<h2>Emitter Control</h2>

<p>Unlike the <b>PRI Emitter</b> application, <b>Playback</b> does not support
TCP connections, only UDP multicast. You can set the multicast address used by
the playback emitters in the <b>Address</b> field.</p.

<p>Since each playback emitter is a SideCar data publisher, running more than
one Playback application on the local LAN will result in data publisher name
conflicts, which the Zeroconf DNS infrastructure will resolve by renaming one
of the data publishers. To mitigate this, you can enter your own unique suffix
in the <b>Pub Suffix</b> text field. Note that if others choose the same suffix
as you, Zeroconf will again have to resolve name conflicts like before.</p>
